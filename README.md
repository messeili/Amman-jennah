## User Stories.

These are the stories that we worked to manage in our code.

1. As a user I want to select a location which i can book a visit date to it.

2. As a client I want one page for the Location.html, because i dont want to create a page for each location.

3. As a user i want to reviwe tha place

## 26/7/2020 Sunday.

Today we worked in out frameWork for the index and location pages, so we can have a better view of the web site,

We have finished the initial design for the web site.

HTML and CSS layout for index-location pages has been finished.

## 27/7/2020 Monday

Today we start working in JavaScript functionality.

We have finished The DOM controlling the location page, so it's content will change according to the user choice.

Thats will solve the problem of having a HTML page for each location.
