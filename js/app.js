  `<p>Wadi Al-Sheta is a winding valley located in Wadi Al-Seer district within the Amman Governorate, and it is a valley connecting the Iraq al-Amir region (from the west) and Marj Al-Hamam region (from the east).</p>
  <p> The area is characterized by valleys and hills overlooking the Dead Sea and the city of Jerusalem, with its spring weather and mild winters, and is located 13 km from the seventh circle at the foot of the valley within a land area of 50 dunums planted with vegetables and fruit trees and interspersed with fresh water springs and an area has been prepared for walking and hiking through trees.</p>
  <p> In general, the area is characterized by fresh air and a calm atmosphere, which gives psychological and physical comfort to the resident, as the place provides all means of recovery and recuperation.</p>`,
  `<p> 
   Wadi Al-Bahath is a very steep valley, meaning itS
   waters descend with a rumble, because the difference 
   in height between its beginning and its end
   is more than 500 meters, and the one standing on 
   one side of the Wadi Al-Bahath sees a twisting path 
   that descends and then ascends and witnesses the 
   deep chasm caused by the earthquakes in distant times. 
   In spite of the ruggedness and horror of that 
   region, its nature has a magnificence and prestige 
   that evokes in itself deep feelings of respect for 
   the motherâ€™s nature

  `<p>Located next to the Al Hussein Public Parks, the museum was established in 2003 upon King Abdullah's wishes. The museum showcases a rare collection of Jordan's vehicles ranging from Hussein bin Ali's cars that came to Amman in 1916 to modern sports cars.</p> 
  <p>The museum has the rover used in filming of Hollywood's movie The Martian, which used Jordan's UNESCO world heritage site Wadi Rum as the backdrop for the Martian scenes. The rover was gifted to Jordan in return for the hospitality with which Jordan received the movie cast and crew.</p>
  <p>There is a plethora of motorcycles, as <b>King Hussein</b> and his son, the current King Abdullah II, were motorcycle enthusiasts, many of which are rare examples of vintage US and British bikes in pristine condition.</p>
  <p> Some of the best cars.</p>
